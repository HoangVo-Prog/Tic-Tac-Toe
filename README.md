**Description**:
The Python code implements a famous tic-tac-toe gameplay between human and AI using minimax algorithm. Player first is to choose what symbol he/she wanna play in the game (X/O). X player is the one who goes first in the game by default. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

**How to Run**: 
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
